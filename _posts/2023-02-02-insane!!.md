(Fun Fact: this was actually an old render i made but i decided not to)

yea and the gameplay i thinked of it to be
like open world 2d where have to around beating every enemy then you can beat the stage
and theres gonna be like bugs on purpose so you can do speed stuff
dw the enemies will take more than 1 hit
also he has to collect smth from the enemies so he can craft stuff to help in in combat
and also he will have base acrobatic spiderman type shi moves
with alot of parkour (i mean alot)
you finna be weaving juking and botting the shi outta your enemies
and the bosses gonna be so fun
anyway thats all i got for the game
thanks for coming to my ted talk bye
